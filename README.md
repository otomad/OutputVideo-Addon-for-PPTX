# OutputVideo-Addon-for-PPTX
**A PowerPoint (2016+) add-on to help export 60fps+ video.**

This is the GUI version of the official subroutine `ActivePresentation.CreateVideo`. 

Due to PowerPoint's export video function in the menu can only export 30fps video at most, but it has built-in related subroutine to export higher frame rate video. Therefore, a graphical interface is made to call this subroutine and configure other related options.

2. Open your Microsoft PowerPoint 2016+.
3. Click "Option" in the PowerPoint start screen.
4. Click "Add-ons" in the left side of the option form.

6. Click the "Add" button.
7. Find the add-on file you just downloaded in the opened dialog, and open it.
8. Click "Close" button.
9. In the "Recording" tab of the Ribbon menu, you will see a new option called "Custom export video" on it.
10. Select the path for video export.
11. Set related configuration options.
12. Click "Output" button, then just wait for PowerPoint export video.
